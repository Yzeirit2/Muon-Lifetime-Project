# Muon-Lifetime-Project

This github repository includes the Von Neumann Monte Carlo simulation code used in the Muon Lifetime project listed on my curriculum vitae. The following file labelled 'Muon_Lifetime_Tarkan.pdf' details the experiment undertaken, with the 'Muon MC Simulation (Notebook).ipynb' file containing the motivation and code for the Monte Carlo simulation (extracted from the aforementioned pdf's appendix).
